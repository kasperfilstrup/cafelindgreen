## 🔄 Future Maintenance Tasks

### For New HTML Designs
1. Follow conversion workflow in memory-bank/conversionWorkflow.md
2. Update component files in _includes/ if design changes
3. Extract new data to YAML files
4. Update styling if needed
5. Test responsive behavior

### Regular Maintenance
- Menu updates via _data/menu.yml editing
- Contact info updates in _config.yml
- Adding new pages by creating new .md files

## 🎯 Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ Family member can edit menu without technical knowledge
- ✅ Site deploys automatically on GitHub Pages
- ✅ Design exactly matches original static files
- ✅ All responsive breakpoints working
- ✅ Component reusability achieved (edit header once, updates everywhere)
- ✅ Zero-config deployment ready

## 🚧 Known Limitations
- Original static HTML files still present (can be deleted after testing)
- Menu items are hardcoded in English (internationalization would need custom solution)
- Social media links are placeholder (need real URLs)

## 📝 Next Steps for User
1. Initialize git repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. Test menu editing workflow
5. Set up custom domain if desired
6. Remove original HTML files after verification
