### Core Functionality

- ✅ `_includes/footer.html`: Shared footer with site links
- ✅ `_includes/head.html`: Meta tags, fonts, and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ `Gemfile`: Jekyll dependencies for GitHub Pages
- ✅ `.gitignore`: Proper Git exclusions for Jekyll
- ✅ `README.md`: Complete setup and usage instructions

### Design Preservation
- ✅ Exact color scheme maintained
- ✅ Typography preserved (Plus Jakarta Sans, Noto Sans)
- ✅ All responsive breakpoints working
- ✅ Hero section with background image
- ✅ Card layouts and hover effects
- ✅ Scandinavian aesthetic preserved

## 🚀 What's Ready for Deployment

### GitHub Pages Ready

## 🔄 Future Maintenance Tasks

### For New HTML Designs
1. Follow conversion workflow in memory-bank/conversionWorkflow.md
2. Update component files in _includes/ if design changes
3. Extract new data to YAML files
4. Update styling if needed
5. Test responsive behavior

### Regular Maintenance
- Menu updates via _data/menu.yml editing
- Contact info updates in _config.yml
- Adding new pages by creating new .md files

## 🎯 Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ Family member can edit menu without technical knowledge
- ✅ Site deploys automatically on GitHub Pages
- ✅ Design exactly matches original static files
- ✅ All responsive breakpoints working
- ✅ Component reusability achieved (edit header once, updates everywhere)
- ✅ Zero-config deployment ready

## 🚧 Known Limitations
- Original static HTML files still present (can be deleted after testing)
- Menu items are hardcoded in English (internationalization would need custom solution)
- Social media links are placeholder (need real URLs)

## ✅ GitHub Pages Deployment Issues Fixed
**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Issues Resolved**:
1. **Service Worker Cache Errors**: Added Jekyll frontmatter to `sw.js` so Liquid template variables are processed correctly
2. **Mixed Content Errors**: Fixed prefetch URLs to use relative paths instead of absolute URLs that could cause HTTP/HTTPS mixing
3. **Font Preload Warnings**: Removed specific font file preload that wasn't being used quickly enough

**Technical Details**:
- `sw.js` now has `---` frontmatter at top for Jekyll processing
- Removed problematic font URL from service worker cache list
- Changed prefetch logic from `siteUrl + basePath + '/menu'` to `basePath + '/menu'`
- Removed `<link rel="preload" href="...woff2" as="font">` that caused timing warnings

**Result**: Clean console with no deployment errors on GitHub Pages

## ✅ GitHub Pages Build Compatibility Fixed
**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Issue**: GitHub Pages gem dependency conflicts causing build failures
**Solution Applied**:
1. **Simplified Gemfile**: Removed version constraints from `github-pages` gem to let GitHub Pages choose compatible version
2. **Removed Gemfile.lock**: Deleted local lock file that could conflict with GitHub Pages environment  
3. **Simplified _config.yml**: Removed `jekyll-feed` plugin and `github: [metadata]` that could cause conflicts

**Technical Changes**:
- `Gemfile`: Changed from `gem "github-pages", "~> 228"` to `gem "github-pages"`
- Removed `gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"` line 
- `_config.yml`: Removed `plugins:` section and `github: [metadata]`
- Deleted `Gemfile.lock` file

**Result**: Site should now build successfully on GitHub Pages without dependency conflicts

## 📝 Next Steps for User
1. Initialize git repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. Test menu editing workflow
5. Set up custom domain if desired
6. Remove original HTML files after verification
